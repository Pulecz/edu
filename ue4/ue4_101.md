
# Installation

### Prerequisites
- Have [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/download) and [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/cs/vs/older-downloads/) installed.
  - By the date of writing UnrealEnginePython supports Unreal Engine versions: 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)  with its path in %PATH% [Windows Environment Variable](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) (latest version by this date is 3.6.0)


I recommend to use source, see [Installation from sources on windows 64-bit](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython#installation-from-sources-on-windows-64-bit) @[github](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython)

If you use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and [cmder](http://cmder.net/), still install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) from regular setup.exe and make sure to check add python to path option.

1. With cmder or whatever git client you use clone the repo somewhere by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython
```
2. Check the settings in Source/UnrealEnginePython/UnrealEnginePython.Build.cs at line 10, [see example](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/blob/master/Source/UnrealEnginePython/UnrealEnginePython.Build.cs#L10).
  Mine on Windows 10 was at %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python/Python36.

    **NOTE:** %HOMEPATH% being [Windows Environment Variable](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html) which is for example C:\Users\Joe\

3. Copy the whole UnrealEnginePython folder to Plugins folder of your Unreal Engine C++ Project

  **NOTE:** If you are starting new C++ Project, wait for Visual Studio to finish its parsing and scan first, close everything then do the copy.
4. Open the Project and check Edit>Plugins>Project>UnrealEnginePython and close the project and Visual Studio.
5. Use "Generate Visual Studio Project files" option in context menu of your \*.uproject
6. Open Visual Studio and "Build Solution" from there. This will take a while(Plugins Folder will grow to 2GB), make sure you don't run into any errors.
7. Verify that it works by opening Windows>Developer Tools>Python Console in Editor menu.

# Examples
### [Example 1 - Moving object](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython#creating-a-new-blueprint-class-managed-by-python)

Start new C++ project and follow Installation of the . In this case I used Top Down Template.

Follow the readme how to create new PyActor object and write script named for example ball.py in Content/Scripts/ in your project.

Only difference between this example and the one in readme is that the object moves to "NorthEast" 1m per second

```python
import unreal_engine as ue

ue.log('Hello I am a Python module')

class Hero:

	# this is called on game start
	def begin_play(self):
		ue.log('Begin Play on Hero class')

	# this is called at every 'tick'
	def tick(self, delta_time):
		# get current location
		location = self.uobject.get_actor_location()
		# increase X and Y honouring delta_time
		location.x += 100 * delta_time
		location.y += 100 * delta_time
		# set new location
		self.uobject.set_actor_location(location)

```
Add the new PyActor object to scene and specify both

**Python Module: ball**

**Python Class: Hero**

in the instance of the object, not in the asset itself.

Make sure you added some object to that blueprint so its visible in game.

Hit play and see your object moving. (If you get no module ball.py, in output log, restart the editor)

Now lets add events, by default your object has collision preset set as BlockAll, that means overlap events will not happen only hit.

Change collision preset to overlap all to enable overlap events.
```python
def on_actor_begin_overlap(self, me, other_actor):
  ue.log('begin overlap')

def on_actor_end_overlap(self, me, other_actor):
  ue.log('end overlap')

def on_actor_hit(self, me, other_actor, normal_impulse, hit_result):
  ue.log('hit!')
```

**NOTE:** You can also add this code to any existing actor just by adding Python component
